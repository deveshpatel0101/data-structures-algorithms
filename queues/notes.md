## Queue

A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.

#### Types of Queues
1. Simple Queue
2. Circular Queue
3. Double Ended Queue
4. Circular Double Ended Queue
5. Priority Queue


#### Applications
1. Scheduling of resources and multiple processes running on same cpu.
2. When data is transferred asynchronously between two processes, Queue is used for synchronization.
3. Queue is a part of implementation in many well known algorithms like Breadth First Search traversal in a Graph.
4. Handling of interrupts in real-time systems. The interrupts are handled in the same order as they arrive, First come first served.
