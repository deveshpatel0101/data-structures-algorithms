## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Instructions

1. To run any of the file make sure that you have go (golang) programming language installed on your machine. Follow how to install instructions from [golang download instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install).
2. Once golang is installed on your machine, just clone or download this repository.
3. Now `cd <folder-name>` into the folder where the file you want to run is located.
4. Now run `go run <file-name>`.

**Note**: If a folder contains multiple `.go` extension files then use `go run <file-name> [<file-name>...]`. For e.g `bst_using_arr` folder contains two files: `bst_using_arr.go` and `traversal.go`. So use the command `go run bst_using_arr.go traversal.go`.

### Description

This repo is for learning data structures and algorithms which is the base of any programming language.
