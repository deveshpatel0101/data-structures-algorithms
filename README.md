# Data Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is one of the most important topic in computer science that every CS student must be proficient in and even non-CS students must have basic understanding of it. It is said that DSA is like bread and butter, necessity of CS. This repository is made for those students (like me :sunglasses:) who are eager to learn and want to implement data strucutures and algorithms.

### Why Go/GoLang and not C, C++ or Java?

I wouldn't disagree that C, C++ or Java wouldn't be a great language to implement DSA as one has to take care of lot things while writing the code like memory allocations and proper deallocations and by doing so one learns a lot.

However the reason why go would also be a good language to implement DSA is that it lacks a lot of magic. There is no operator overloading, so no way to hide extra complexity. An index operation is O(1), a loop is O(n) - always. There are no generics, so a lot of extra abstractions and helpers don't exist, which is actually pretty great. There is no laziness or other compiler-driven magic that might alter the runtime of your algorithms significantly. And Go has pointer and low-level primitives for slices, meaning it is apparent when data is packed or when data has an extra indirection. _In short_: Go make the actual algorithmic execution obvious from the code, which is a good thing to learn algorithms.

**Conclusion**: Go would also be a good language to get started with implementing Data Structures and Algorithms. :computer:

### Instructions

1. To get started make sure that you have go programming language installed on your computer. Follow how to install instructions from [golang download instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install).
2. Once go is installed on your machine, just clone or download this repository.
3. Now `cd <folder-name>` into the folder where the file you want to run is located.
4. Now run `go run <file-name>`.

### Example

Let's assume that I want to run files located in `graphs/directed_unweighted` directory then the syntax to run it would be:

```
cd graphs/directed_unweighted/

go run graph.go traversal.go
```

**Note**: If a folder contains multiple `go` files then use `go run <file-name> [<file-name>...]`. For e.g `bst_using_arr` folder contains two files: `bst_using_arr.go` and `traversal.go`. So use the command `go run bst_using_arr.go traversal.go`.
