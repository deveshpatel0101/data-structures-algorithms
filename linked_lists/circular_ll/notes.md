#### Cicular Linked List

In the last node of a list, the link field often contains a null reference, a special value is used to indicate the lack of further nodes. A less common convention is to make it point to the first node of the list; in that case, the list is said to be 'circular' or 'circularly linked'; otherwise, it is said to be 'open' or 'linear'. It is a list where the last pointer points to the first node.

#### Operations

1. Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.
2. Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.
3. Display − Displays the complete list.
4. Search − Searches an element using the given key.
5. Delete − Deletes an element using the given key.
6. Reverse - Reverses the linked list.
