#### Doubly Linked List

In a 'doubly linked list', each node contains, besides the next-node link, a second link field pointing to the 'previous' node in the sequence. The two links may be called 'forward('s') and 'backwards', or 'next' and 'prev'('previous').

Many modern operating systems use doubly linked lists to maintain references to active processes, threads, and other dynamic objects.

#### Operations

1. Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.
2. Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.
3. Display − Displays the complete list.
4. Search − Searches an element using the given key.
5. Delete − Deletes an element using the given key.
6. Reverse - Reverses the linked list.
